* Roadmap
  [ ] Can search in current directory for all files matching a regex
  [ ] Can rename files that match using a name that includes `{1}` to reference matching groups
  [ ] Can rename files based on an internal iterator (ie. use `IMG{iter}.jpg` to create  `IMG1.jpg`, `IMG2.jpg`, etc.)
  [ ] Move all renamed to a target location
  [ ] Expose other variables that can be used in the pattern name
  [ ] Copy and rename
